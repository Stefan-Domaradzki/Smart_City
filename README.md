# Django App for Notifying Users About Road Traffic in RzeszÃ³w

## Overview

This is a project Iâ€™m developing as part of my coursework at RzeszÃ³w University of Technology, under the guidance of PhD MichaÅ‚ PiÄ™tal. The goal is to build an application that uses historical traffic data from the city of RzeszÃ³w to notify users when specific roads are congested.

Currently, I can't share the dataset, but the column names are fairly self-explanatory, so you should be able to use your own data without issues.

Besides aiming to get an A in the subject, I'm treating this project as an opportunity to learn as much as possible about data processing and app development. Apologies in advance if something doesnâ€™t yet make perfect sense ðŸ˜Š

## Future Plans
The project is still in its early stages, but I plan to include a simulation component based on historical data. Since I currently donâ€™t have access to real-time traffic data, I plan to simulate it using Kafka for data streaming and process it with Apache Flink before storing it in the database.

Other planned features include:

* Integration of additional city data (e.g., weather, recent accidents, and news).
* A front-end with three panels:
    * Live traffic data visualization.
    * Historical traffic trends.
    * Traffic predictions using a machine learning model.
